;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; Literal String Mode is a minor mode for editing multi-line literal
;;; strings in a dedicated buffer.
;;;
;;; When enabled, edit the literal string at point using C-c "
;;; (literal-string-edit-string), this will copy the (unescaped and
;;; deindented) content of the string to a dedicated literal string
;;; editing buffer using `edit-indirect`.
;;;
;;; To exit the current literal string buffer and copy the edited
;;; string back into the original source buffer with correct quoting
;;; and escape sequences, press C-c c (edit-indirect-commit)
;;;
;;; To discard your changes to the editing buffer, press C-c C-k
;;; (edit-indirect-abort)
;;;
;;; To enable literal-string-mode in your preferred programming modes,
;;; turn it on using the relevant mode hooks.
;;;
;;; You can customize `literal-string-editing-mode` to set the major
;;; mode of the editing buffer.  (For instance, to markdown-mode).
